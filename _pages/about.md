Hello! My name is Anish Pandya, and I'm a fourth-year physics and mathematics student at UT Austin. I'm interested in questions from non-equilibrium statistical physics, fluid dynamics, and biophysics! I'm seeking a graduate position starting in 2025 to study these topics further.

Currently, I am an intern at the Max Planck Institute: Physics of Complex Systems with Dr. Christina Kurzthaler. I also work with Professor William Gilpin at UT Austin, and Dr. James Holehouse and Professor Chris Kempes at the Santa Fe Institute. I enjoy problems from statistical physics, and I'm inspired by the field's history and future.
