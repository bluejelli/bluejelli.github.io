### Microswimmers in porous media.
I worked with Dr. Christina Kurzthaler and Yanis Baouche at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems to study sperm swimming in their natural environments.

### Stochastic models of gene expression.

In progress with Dr. James Holehouse and Professor Chris Kempes at the Santa Fe Institute. I studied volume-dependent models of gene expression and am currently studying the noise input to models of gene expression. 

### Decision Tree Learning.

In progress with Professor William Gilpin at UT Austin.
