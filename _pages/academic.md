Sketching and sampling data reduction methods for machine learning interatomic potentials
===
In this project for CSE 392: Matrix and Tensor Algorithms, my partner Sung Jung and I investigated sketching and sampling methods from randomized numerical linear algebra for dataset reduction in computational materials science, as compared to systematic maximum entropy methods. We found that leverage score sampling and Gaussian sketching techniques produce comparable results to the maximum entropy method.

[Simulating Anderson Localization on arbitrary graphs](https://github.com/ravikoka/qgraph)
===
In this project, Ravi Koka, Abby Perryman, Patrick Devaney and I simulated the Anderson localization phenomena on arbitrary graphs through modifying the hopping term (to include the graph Laplacian of an arbitrary graph) in the Anderson Hamiltonian and simulating the diffusion-disorder tradeoff across different graph topologies, disorder strengths, and random graph structures. This project was for PHY 381C: Computational Physics.

Ravi Koka, Ananya Kalava, and I wrote an article about cosmology for our PHY 375R class. I made the gravitational lensing animation at the end using Manim!
