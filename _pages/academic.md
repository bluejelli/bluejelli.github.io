## Fall 2023. [Simulating Anderson Localization on arbitrary graphs](https://github.com/ravikoka/qgraph)

In this project, Ravi Koka, Abby Perryman, Patrick Devaney and I simulated the Anderson localization phenomena on arbitrary graphs through modifying the hopping term (to include the graph Laplacian of an arbitrary graph) in the Anderson Hamiltonian and simulating the diffusion-disorder tradeoff across different graph topologies, disorder strengths, and random graph structures. This project was for PHY 381C: Computational Physics.

## Spring 2024. Sketching and sampling data reduction methods for machine learning interatomic potentials

In this project for CSE 392: Matrix and Tensor Algorithms, my partner Sung Jung and I investigated sketching and sampling methods from randomized numerical linear algebra for dataset reduction in computational materials science, as compared to systematic maximum entropy methods. We found that leverage score sampling and Gaussian sketching techniques produce comparable results to the maximum entropy method.


## Spring 2024. [Cosmology Article](https://cosmologygr.wordpress.com/)

Ravi Koka, Ananya Kaalava, and I wrote an article about cosmology for our PHY 375R class. I made the gravitational lensing animation at the end using Manim!

## Fall 2025. Statistical Physics of Large Scale Structure Formation.

Ananya Kaalava and I presented about the statistics of dark matter halo formation. I am writing notes on the statistical physics of large scale structure formation.
